# Watcher of Friends Online

**The module outputs online friends in VK to the terminal.**

# How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.

# Quickstart
**Ways to use:**
- Have to use  module `vk_friends_online.py` after `python3` ,then should enter `login` and `password` in terminal.

Example of script launch on Linux, Python 3.5:

```bash
$ python3 vk_friends_online.py
Enter login: +7**********
Password:********
1) Polo Marco
2) Columbus Christopher
